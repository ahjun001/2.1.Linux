== Summary
Isolate specific environments for:

* *Develop*

All artifacts in a subdir under /tmp, with automatic setup and cleanup
Loging

* *Test*

ShellSpec managed

* *Deploy*

Would use real life hardware and environment 

== Workflow


== Technically

Bash scripts should be sourced from one another, keeping the environment consistent.

Each script should be individually ran & tested.


== Lessons learned: Technical issues or time over-consuming steps encountered during project & resolutions / mitigations

define ROOT_DIR in the main and submodules, it is not used in the environment file

`"ROOT="$(cd "${BASH_SOURCE[0]%/*.sh}" && pwd)" && +
. "$ROOT"/lib/environments.sh && +
cd "$ROOT" || exit 1
