== Summary

With many machines, and many OS and VM on each machines, keeping documents is best done on an external disk. Here Toshiba Canvio Partner 4TB, USB 3.2, micro B port.

The drive has two partitions:
. Tosh_4TB: ext4 partition that contains all documents
. Tosh_backup: crypted, btrfs partition that contains packageÂ´ settings, emails, .destkop files

This repository contains batch files to maintain both partitions.

== Workflow

. Tosh_4TB
Maintain Tosh_4TB with process & bash scripts, as follows:
- remove dupes on Tosh_4TB  link:/home/perubu/Documents/Github/2.1.linux/4.Projects/del_duplicates_on_hd/dupes_all.sh[./dupes_all.sh]
- remove all pdf files that might have been loaded by Wechat, or are no longer relevant 
- remove dupes between machine HD and Tosh_4TB to prevent copying unecessary files

. Tosh_backup
Make regular backups of the following:
- emails files (first clean files from large downloads as much as possible)
- nvim
- .desktop files

== Technically
All with bash scripts and packages readily available on Fedora / KDE Plasma 
Remove dupes can be done with

* fdupes

fdupes creates a list of dupes that can be selected for deletion within the program, or create a file that can be later edited into a new batch file.

* rdfind

== Lessons learned: Technical issues or time over-consuming steps encountered during project & resolutions / mitigations
